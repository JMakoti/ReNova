# üåç **Project Proposal: ReNova ‚Äì Renewing Waste into Value - Renew + Innovate through recycling and art**

## **1. Project Title**

**ReNova ‚Äì A Mobile and Community-Driven Platform for Sustainable Waste Management**

---

## **2. Background**

Rapid urbanization has intensified waste management challenges in cities and peri-urban areas. Inefficient collection systems, low recycling rates, and weak public participation have led to pollution, health risks, and unsustainable urban living.

At the same time, community groups, youth associations, schools, and informal waste pickers are already playing key roles in local waste management but lack coordination and digital tools to scale their impact.

**ReNova bridges this gap** by combining:

* A **mobile-first platform** for waste tracking, reporting, and recycling incentives.
* **Community engagement structures** like EcoSpots and Trash-to-Art workshops.
* **Group-based waste monitoring** at the sub-location level, allowing municipalities and communities to track progress together.

---

## **3. Problem Statement**

Waste mismanagement persists because of:

* Irregular or unreliable collection schedules.
* Limited access to recycling and drop-off stations.
* Low incentives for responsible waste disposal.
* Poor data for municipal planning.
* Disconnected community groups working in isolation.

Without a digital and community-integrated approach, urban waste problems will continue to escalate, hindering progress toward **SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities)** and **SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production)**.

---

## **4. Project Goal**

To build a **community-powered digital ecosystem** that transforms waste into value by digitizing waste collection, empowering groups at the sub-location level, and promoting recycling, creative reuse, and sustainable living.

---

## **5. Objectives**

1. **Develop the ReNova Mobile App** for reporting, tracking, recycling incentives, and group-based waste dashboards.
2. **Engage Community Groups** (youth, women, schools, waste pickers, neighborhood associations) in structured waste collection and reporting.
3. **Establish EcoSpots** ‚Äì low-cost, community-managed recycling stations for plastics, glass, paper, and e-waste.
4. **Promote Awareness & Education** through gamified challenges, school programs, and public campaigns.
5. **Foster Creative Transformation** via Trash-to-Art workshops, exhibitions, and green entrepreneurship.

## **7. Stakeholders & Groups Involved**

ReNova connects and empowers **groups actively involved in waste collection at the sub-location level**, including:

* **Community-Based Organizations (CBOs)** ‚Äì Youth groups, women‚Äôs groups, and neighborhood clean-up teams.
* **Schools & Eco-Clubs** ‚Äì Student-led initiatives promoting waste segregation and awareness.
* **Informal Waste Pickers & Cooperatives** ‚Äì Collectors and recyclers who earn livelihoods from waste.
* **Private Waste Companies** ‚Äì Contractors providing structured collection services.
* **Neighborhood Associations** ‚Äì Estate committees and residents‚Äô associations.
* **Faith-Based Groups** ‚Äì Churches, mosques, and temples organizing clean-up drives.
* **Municipal Ward/Sub-Location Offices** ‚Äì Local government structures coordinating sanitation.

---

## **8. Expected Outcomes**

* Cleaner neighborhoods with reduced illegal dumping.
* Increased **waste segregation and recycling rates**.
* Transparent, **location-based data** on waste collection and recycling.
* Strengthened collaboration among groups, municipalities, and businesses.
* Creation of **green jobs** in recycling, upcycling, and eco-entrepreneurship.
* Contribution toward **SDG 11** and **SDG 12** targets.

---

## **9. Implementation Strategy**

* **Phase 1:** Stakeholder mapping, community engagement, and app prototype design.
* **Phase 2:** Mobile app development and pilot EcoSpots setup.
* **Phase 3:** Awareness campaigns, Trash-to-Art workshops, and school programs.
* **Phase 4:** Pilot testing in one sub-location with group-based tracking dashboards.
* **Phase 5:** Scale-up to other wards/cities, establish municipal partnerships, and expand EcoSpots.

---

## **10. Beneficiaries**

* **Residents:** Cleaner environment and improved services.
* **Community Groups:** Recognition, incentives, and digital tools for impact tracking.
* **Youth & Schools:** Skills development, eco-leadership, and innovation.
* **Waste Collectors & Informal Pickers:** Formal inclusion and improved earnings.
